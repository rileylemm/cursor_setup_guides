This section contains comprehensive documentation for deployment, configuration, and operations of the system.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents
- [Deployment Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Overall deployment architecture and environments
- [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) - Step-by-step installation instructions
- [Deployment Options](DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) - Different ways to deploy the system

## Key Concepts

### Deployment Architecture
[AI: Replace with project-specific deployment architecture]
- Environments: [e.g., Development, Staging, Production]
- Infrastructure: [e.g., Cloud Providers, Container Orchestration]
- Deployment Flow: [e.g., CI/CD Pipeline, Release Process]
- Scaling Strategy: [e.g., Auto-scaling, Load Balancing]

### Configuration Management
[AI: Replace with project-specific configuration]
- Environment Variables: [e.g., Development, Production]
- Secrets Management: [e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager]
- Configuration Files: [e.g., YAML, JSON, Environment-specific]
- Feature Flags: [e.g., Feature Toggles, A/B Testing]

### Operations Management
[AI: Replace with project-specific operations]
- Monitoring: [e.g., Metrics, Logging, Alerts]
- Backup: [e.g., Database Backups, File Storage]
- Recovery: [e.g., Disaster Recovery, Failover]
- Maintenance: [e.g., Updates, Patches, Scaling]
