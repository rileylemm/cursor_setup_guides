This document provides a template for documenting your project's data architecture. Use this structure to define your data storage, processing, and flow patterns.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- [ ] Define primary data stores
- [ ] Identify processing systems
- [ ] Plan data flow patterns
- [ ] Specify integration points
- [ ] Document data lifecycle

### Design Principles
- [ ] Establish data modeling principles
- [ ] Define consistency requirements
- [ ] Plan for scalability
- [ ] Consider security requirements
- [ ] Document compliance needs

## Data Storage Architecture

### [Storage Type 1]
Describe your primary storage solution:
- Purpose and use cases
- Data types supported
- Capacity and scaling approach
- Backup and recovery strategy
- Security considerations

### [Storage Type 2]
Describe your secondary storage solution:
- Purpose and use cases
- Data types supported
- Capacity and scaling approach
- Backup and recovery strategy
- Security considerations

## Data Processing Architecture

### Processing Pipeline
Describe your data processing flow:
- Data sources and inputs
- Processing stages and transformations
- Quality checks and validations
- Error handling and recovery
- Output destinations

### Processing Components
- [ ] Define ingestion patterns
- [ ] Plan transformation logic
- [ ] Specify validation rules
- [ ] Configure error handling
- [ ] Set up monitoring

## Data Flow Architecture

### Flow Patterns
Describe how data moves through your system:
- Entry points and data sources
- Processing and transformation steps
- Storage and persistence
- Distribution and delivery
- Integration with other systems

### Integration Points
- [ ] Define API endpoints
- [ ] Plan message queues
- [ ] Configure event streams
- [ ] Set up data pipelines
- [ ] Document interfaces

## Sample Architecture: Generic Data System

Here's a conceptual example of how to document a data system architecture:

### Storage Components
Consider a system that manages customer data and order processing:

1. Primary Storage
   - Purpose: Stores core customer and order information
   - Data Types: Customer profiles, order records, transaction history
   - Characteristics: High consistency, frequent updates, relational structure
   - Considerations: Data integrity, transaction support, backup frequency

2. Secondary Storage
   - Purpose: Stores analytics and reporting data
   - Data Types: Aggregated statistics, historical trends, reporting data
   - Characteristics: Read-heavy, batch updates, columnar structure
   - Considerations: Query performance, data retention, archive strategy

### Processing Pipeline
The system processes orders through several stages:

1. Order Entry
   - Customer submits order
   - System validates order details
   - Inventory is checked
   - Payment is processed

2. Order Processing
   - Order is confirmed
   - Inventory is updated
   - Shipping is arranged
   - Customer is notified

3. Analytics Processing
   - Order data is aggregated
   - Reports are generated
   - Trends are analyzed
   - Insights are stored

### Data Flow
Data moves through the system in these patterns:

1. Customer Journey
   - Customer creates account
   - Places order
   - Receives confirmation
   - Gets shipping updates
   - Receives product
   - Provides feedback

2. Business Operations
   - Orders are processed
   - Inventory is managed
   - Reports are generated
   - Analytics are updated
   - Performance is monitored

### Integration Points
The system connects with various external services:

1. Customer-Facing
   - Web interface
   - Mobile application
   - Email notifications
   - Customer support

2. Business Operations
   - Inventory management
   - Payment processing
   - Shipping services
   - Analytics platforms

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- [ ] Define encryption requirements
- [ ] Plan access control
- [ ] Configure audit logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Document compliance

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Define backup schedule
- [ ] Plan disaster recovery
- [ ] Configure retention
- [ ] Set up verification
- [ ] Document procedures
