## Sample Structure: Generic User System

Here's a conceptual example of how to organize user management:

### User Management Flow
Consider a system that manages user accounts:

1. Account Management
   - Registration
   - Profile setup
   - Settings configuration
   - Account recovery
   - Account deletion

2. Profile Management
   - Profile updates
   - Preference settings
   - Avatar management
   - Contact information
   - Privacy settings

3. Settings Management
   - Notification settings
   - Security settings
   - Privacy settings
   - Integration settings
   - Preference settings

### Data Management
The system manages user data through:

1. Profile Data
   - Personal information
   - Contact details
   - Preferences
   - Privacy settings
   - Access controls

2. Account Data
   - Account information
   - Security settings
   - Recovery options
   - Verification status
   - Access levels
