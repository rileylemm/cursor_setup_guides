This document outlines the overall architecture and design principles of the backend system.

## System Overview

### Architecture Principles
[AI: Replace with project-specific principles]
- Scalability: [e.g., Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing]
- Reliability: [e.g., Fault Tolerance, High Availability]
- Security: [e.g., Authentication, Authorization, Data Protection]
- Maintainability: [e.g., Modular Design, Clear Boundaries]

### System Components
[AI: Replace with project-specific components]
- API Gateway: [e.g., Request Routing, Rate Limiting]
- Service Layer: [e.g., Business Logic, Service Communication]
- Data Layer: [e.g., Database Access, Caching]
- External Services: [e.g., Third-party Integrations]

## Component Design

### API Gateway
[AI: Replace with project-specific gateway design]
- Routing: [e.g., URL Patterns, Method Handling]
- Authentication: [e.g., JWT Validation, Session Management]
- Rate Limiting: [e.g., Request Quotas, Throttling]
- Caching: [e.g., Response Caching, Cache Invalidation]

### Service Layer
[AI: Replace with project-specific service design]
- Service Organization: [e.g., Domain Services, Microservices]
- Communication: [e.g., REST, gRPC, Message Queues]
- State Management: [e.g., Service State, Distributed State]
- Error Handling: [e.g., Error Types, Recovery Strategies]

### Data Layer
[AI: Replace with project-specific data layer design]
- Storage Solutions: [e.g., Relational DB, Document Store]
- Caching Strategy: [e.g., Cache Levels, Invalidation]
- Data Access: [e.g., ORM, Query Builders]
- Data Migration: [e.g., Schema Changes, Data Transfer]

## Data Flow

### Request Processing
[AI: Replace with project-specific request flow]
1. Request Reception: [e.g., Load Balancer, API Gateway]
2. Authentication: [e.g., Token Validation, Permission Check]
3. Business Logic: [e.g., Service Processing, Data Access]
4. Response Generation: [e.g., Data Formatting, Caching]

### Background Processing
[AI: Replace with project-specific background processing]
- Task Queues: [e.g., Job Processing, Background Tasks]
- Event Processing: [e.g., Event Bus, Message Processing]
- Scheduled Tasks: [e.g., Cron Jobs, Periodic Tasks]
- Data Synchronization: [e.g., Data Replication, Sync Jobs]

## Integration Points

### External Services
[AI: Replace with project-specific integrations]
- Authentication Services: [e.g., OAuth, SSO]
- Storage Services: [e.g., S3, CDN]
- Message Services: [e.g., Email, SMS]
- Analytics Services: [e.g., Logging, Monitoring]

### Internal Services
[AI: Replace with project-specific internal services]
- Service Discovery: [e.g., Service Registry, Load Balancing]
- Configuration Management: [e.g., Config Service, Feature Flags]
- Monitoring: [e.g., Metrics Collection, Alerting]
- Logging: [e.g., Log Aggregation, Log Analysis]

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure
[AI: Replace with project-specific infrastructure]
- Cloud Provider: [e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure]
- Container Orchestration: [e.g., Kubernetes, ECS]
- Network Design: [e.g., VPC, Subnets, Security Groups]
- Storage Solutions: [e.g., Block Storage, Object Storage]

### Scaling Strategy
[AI: Replace with project-specific scaling]
- Horizontal Scaling: [e.g., Service Replication]
- Vertical Scaling: [e.g., Resource Upgrades]
- Auto-scaling: [e.g., Scaling Triggers, Policies]
- Load Balancing: [e.g., Load Distribution, Health Checks]

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
[AI: Replace with project-specific security]
- User Authentication: [e.g., JWT, OAuth, Session Management]
- Role-Based Access: [e.g., RBAC, Permission Levels]
- API Security: [e.g., API Keys, Rate Limiting]
- Data Security: [e.g., Encryption, Data Protection]

### Network Security
[AI: Replace with project-specific network security]
- Network Isolation: [e.g., VPC, Network Policies]
- Traffic Protection: [e.g., SSL/TLS, WAF]
- Access Control: [e.g., Firewalls, Security Groups]
- Monitoring: [e.g., Security Logs, Intrusion Detection]
