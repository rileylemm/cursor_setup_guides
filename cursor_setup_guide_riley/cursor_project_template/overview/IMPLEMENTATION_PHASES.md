This document outlines the implementation phases, milestones, and deliverables for the project, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Phase Overview

### Phase Structure
[AI: Replace with project-specific phases]
- Phase 1: [e.g., Foundation & Test Infrastructure]
  - Duration: [e.g., 4 weeks]
  - Objectives: [e.g., Core infrastructure and test framework]
- Phase 2: [e.g., Core Development with TDD]
  - Duration: [e.g., 8 weeks]
  - Objectives: [e.g., Main features with comprehensive tests]
- Phase 3: [e.g., Enhancement & Test Coverage]
  - Duration: [e.g., 4 weeks]
  - Objectives: [e.g., Optimization and test refinement]
