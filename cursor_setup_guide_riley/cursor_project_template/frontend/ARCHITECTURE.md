This document outlines the frontend architecture, including component design, state management, and data flow patterns.

## Application Structure

### Architecture Principles
[AI: Replace with project-specific principles]
- Component-Based: [e.g., Reusable Components, Composition]
- State Management: [e.g., Centralized State, Local State]
- Performance: [e.g., Code Splitting, Lazy Loading]
- Maintainability: [e.g., Clear Structure, Separation of Concerns]

### Application Components
[AI: Replace with project-specific components]
- Core Components: [e.g., Layout, Navigation]
- Feature Components: [e.g., Forms, Tables]
- Shared Components: [e.g., Buttons, Inputs]
- Page Components: [e.g., Home, Dashboard]

## Component Architecture

### Component Design
[AI: Replace with project-specific component design]
- Component Types: [e.g., Presentational, Container]
  - Structure: [e.g., Props, Events]
  - Lifecycle: [e.g., Mounting, Updates]
- Component Patterns: [e.g., HOC, Render Props]
  - Usage: [e.g., Code Reuse, Logic Sharing]
- Component Testing: [e.g., Unit Tests, Integration]
  - Tools: [e.g., Jest, React Testing Library]

### Component Library
[AI: Replace with project-specific component library]
- Design System: [e.g., Material UI, Tailwind]
  - Components: [e.g., Atoms, Molecules]
  - Theming: [e.g., Colors, Typography]
- Custom Components: [e.g., Branded Components]
  - Features: [e.g., Accessibility, Responsive]

## State Management

### State Architecture
[AI: Replace with project-specific state architecture]
- Global State: [e.g., Redux, Context]
  - Structure: [e.g., Actions, Reducers]
  - Middleware: [e.g., Thunks, Sagas]
- Local State: [e.g., useState, useReducer]
  - Usage: [e.g., Component State]
  - Patterns: [e.g., Custom Hooks]

### Data Flow
[AI: Replace with project-specific data flow]
- Data Fetching: [e.g., REST, GraphQL]
  - Patterns: [e.g., SWR, React Query]
- State Updates: [e.g., Immutable Updates]
  - Patterns: [e.g., Action Creators]
- Side Effects: [e.g., useEffect]
  - Management: [e.g., Cleanup, Dependencies]

## Routing

### Route Structure
[AI: Replace with project-specific routing]
- Route Organization: [e.g., Nested Routes]
  - Structure: [e.g., Route Groups]
  - Guards: [e.g., Authentication]
- Route Features: [e.g., Code Splitting]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Lazy Loading]

### Navigation
[AI: Replace with project-specific navigation]
- Navigation Patterns: [e.g., Deep Linking]
  - Features: [e.g., History, Back/Forward]
- Route Transitions: [e.g., Animations]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Page Transitions]

## Performance

### Optimization
[AI: Replace with project-specific optimization]
- Code Splitting: [e.g., Route-based]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Dynamic Imports]
- Bundle Optimization: [e.g., Tree Shaking]
  - Tools: [e.g., Webpack, Vite]
- Asset Optimization: [e.g., Images]
  - Strategies: [e.g., Lazy Loading]

### Caching
[AI: Replace with project-specific caching]
- Data Caching: [e.g., SWR, React Query]
  - Strategies: [e.g., Stale-While-Revalidate]
- Asset Caching: [e.g., Service Workers]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Cache API]

## Security

### Frontend Security
[AI: Replace with project-specific security]
- Authentication: [e.g., JWT Storage]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Secure Storage]
- Authorization: [e.g., Role-based Access]
  - Features: [e.g., Route Guards]
- Data Protection: [e.g., XSS Prevention]
  - Measures: [e.g., Input Sanitization]

### Security Best Practices
[AI: Replace with project-specific security practices]
- HTTPS: [e.g., Secure Communication]
  - Implementation: [e.g., CSP]
- Input Validation: [e.g., Form Validation]
  - Tools: [e.g., Form Libraries]
- Error Handling: [e.g., Error Boundaries]
  - Implementation: [e.g., Fallback UI]
