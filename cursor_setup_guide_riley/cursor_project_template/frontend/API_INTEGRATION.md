This document outlines the API integration architecture, including client implementation, request handling, and response management.

## API Architecture

### Client Implementation
- [ ] Define client structure
- [ ] Plan request handling
- [ ] Design response management
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Configure retry logic

### API Patterns

- [ ] Plan caching patterns
- [ ] Design error patterns
- [ ] Implement retry patterns

## Request Handling

### Request Management
- [ ] Implement request creation
- [ ] Define request validation
- [ ] Plan request transformation

- [ ] Configure request retry

### Request Types
- [ ] Document GET requests
- [ ] Define POST requests
- [ ] Plan PUT requests
- [ ] Design DELETE requests
- [ ] Implement PATCH requests

## Response Management

### Response Handling
- [ ] Implement response parsing
